A list of game events which the model must be cabable of. 

- An object being struck by a bullet
	- Handled by a loop which checks so see if a bullet coordinate is within the hitbox 
	  for all GameObjects. When such an object is found, a method is call objectName.Hit().
	  If the object gets detroyed by the hit, then it is removed from the list of GameObjects.
- An object moves
	- Handled by a loop which iterates through all game objects and calls a method 
	  which all of them (e.g. DoNextAction()). The logic for all of these methods will
	  be different.
- An object runs into another object. (Beta)
	- I don't know how to do this without a TON of iterations which would take too much time
- An object shoots
	- Since every object will have a direction, you can create a bullet which is moving
	  in that direction as well at whatever speep those bullets should be moving at. Have a 
	  Shoot() method for every object type which shoots. 
	- But you must check to see that an object IsLoaded before you shoot. Otherwise one could shoot
	- in rapid sucession and destroy everything in the world right away. 

AI Control
- IF the object is in the plottables list, then have it do smart stuff. Otherwise it's just sitting there. 
- When the DoNextAciton() method is called, have a random number rolled. If the number is below a certain threshold,
  then have the ship point directly at the player ship and start moving there. If the random number is within another
  interval, then have the ship Shoot(). If the random number is above both of these intervals, then merely have it move
  in a strait direction. 

Base destruction
- Depending on the level, a base must get hit ten times before it is destroyed. 

Ship destruction. If a ship gets hit once, It's dead. 

How to move the player's ship. 
As the controller iterates through the objects and calls DoNextAction for each object, how am I to move the player's ship? 
- Have an instance variable for the palyer's ship which is is adjusted by the keys going up and down. 
- Make the player's ship an singleton? 
- Instance variables
